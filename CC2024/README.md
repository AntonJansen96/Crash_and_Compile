### 02 - Aliquot sequence

### 03 - Random Tribonacci

### 04 - Jufman's walk

### 05 - Jufman's dreamwalk

You've finally managed to get home, and fell into a drunken stupor, seconds after you hit the bed. In your dreams you continue 'walking'. No longer limited by the rules of reality, your dreamwalk takes to the sky. As a result, you keep counting every step, however this time you only turn left when a number has only one reason to be juf, and you turn up when a number has more than 1 reason to be juf. What number do you count when you reach a distance of 40 steps from your starting position? Jufnumbers are numbers that are divisible by 7, contain 7 or are palindromes. The distance of 40 steps is measured using the taxicab metric (1-norm). You always take a step when counting, so when you turn left or up you also take a step. Turning left is what you expect it to be, a rotation of 90 degrees around the axis running from your feet to your head (and then taking a step). Turning up is pretty much laying down on your back, which corresponds to a rotation around some vaguely defined axis that runs through the left and right side of your body, (and flying up 1 step into the sky).

### 13 - Around the clock

### 14 - Around the clock, around the clock, around the clock, ...

The analog clock in the Francken room has 2 hands. Whenever the the minute hand of the clock passes the hour hand, someone from Idun brings you a new clock that somehow is twice as slow as the clock which hands just passed. How many times do all the minute hands of all the clocks lap their hour hands, during a full day? For the purpose of the question a day starts at 0:00:00, and ends at 23:59:59. The clocks you get from Idun all start at 0:00:00. Note: during a race you lap someone when you not only overtake them, but you also did at least a full round extra.

### 16 - Atomic scrabble

You stare at the projector screen and your mind wanders the the time you attempted to solve the AIVD chrismass puzzle. You remeber seeing those insanely difficult to decipher questions on the screen. One time you had to do something with the scrabble score of letters, and figure out how that affected some sort of encoding. You think. You can't really remember what it was. Suddenly you hear a familiar voice whispering: You're thinking about scrabble now, aren't you? I have a question for you: 'What is the longest word in the english language scrabble dictionary that does not have the property that shorter words could be made from its letters?' Note: The dictionary can be found here: https://vierdeman.blob.core.windows.net/vierdeman/dictionary.json Second note: If you find multiple possible answers, choose the one with the highest scrabble score.

### 16 - Vrijmibo

Since nobody is around you use your leet-haxxor skills to take a peek into the streep database. Use this opportunity to figure out how many beers have been drunk during vrijmiboes, both official ones and unofficial ones. Note that vrijmiboes necessarily start on Fridays, but don't necessarily have to end on Fridays, so for the purpose of this question start the borrel at 12:00 and end it at 9:00 the following day. You can find the database here: https://vierdeman.blob.core.windows.net/streeppc/francken-transactions.sqlite
