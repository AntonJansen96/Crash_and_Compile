# While everybody is monopolizing the streets, you have been busy practicing you
# klaverjas cheating skills. You have a deck of 32 cards for a game of klaverjas
# and managed to place the four aces on top. You've perfected the art of perfect
# cuts and shuffles, and set out to construct a system that allows you to deal all
# aces back to your own team. Starting and ending with a perfect cut in the middle
# of the deck you execute 1 to 11 of the following shuffles:
# riffle shuffle - 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 1 4 2 5 3 6, 
# monge shuffle - 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 6 4 2 1 3 5, 
# sake shuffle - 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 3 2 1 6 5 4,
# peel shuffle - 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 3 4 2 5 1 6. 
# What fraction of these shuffles will result in all aces being dealt to your
# team? Note that the cards are dealt as 3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3, you start with
# the player left of you, and your team mate is opposite of you.
